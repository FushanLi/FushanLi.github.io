## About Me
I am Fushan Li. I am a MSc student in Computer Science at the University of Alberta. I am fortunate enough to work with my advisors, [Prof. Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/index.html) and [Prof. Dale Schuurmans](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~dale/). 
I am interested in problems of making machines possess intelligence and language capabilities.

You can reach me at fushan AT ualberta dot ca.
